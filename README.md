# Prisma Schema Parser and Formatter

Typescript library for parsing, traversing, and formatting
[Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference) files.
Based on the [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)
[grammar](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/blob/main/libs/datamodel/schema-ast/src/parser/datamodel.pest) in the Prisma source
(ported from [pest](https://pest.rs/) to [PEG.js](https://pegjs.org/)),
its goal is to parse any valid Prisma schema.
Unit tests ensure 100% coverage of the hand-written Typescript code and the rule code generated by PEG.js.
(There is a small amount of error reporting and unused feature code in the generated parser that is either unreachable or infeasible to test.)

## Goals

- Parse and format any valid Prisma schema
- Provide a complete and statically typed abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Support legacy features like type aliases and GraphQL-style required type and list syntax
- Preserve all non-whitespace constructs in the source, including comments
- Preserve the source location of all high-level constructs
- Provide utility functions to traverse and analyze the AST

### Non-goals

- Continued parsing of invalid schemas beyond the first syntax error
- Validation of the schema, such as type resolution or database-specific features
- Preservation of whitespace

## Installation

```sh
npm add @loancrate/prisma-schema-parser
```

## Usage

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import { formatAst, parsePrismaSchema } from "@loancrate/prisma-schema-parser";

const ast = parsePrismaSchema(
  readFileSync("test-data/schema.prisma", { encoding: "utf8" }),
);
// ... manipulate the schema ...
console.log(formatAst(ast));
```
